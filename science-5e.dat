static electricity,a short flow of negative charges that occurs after those charges have built up on the surface of an object
current electricity,continuous flow of negative charges through a material
conductor,a material that allows electricity to flow through it.
insulator,a material that does not allow electricity to flow through it.
resistor,reduces the amount of electricity that can flow through a material.
circuit,an unbroken path through which negative charges flow, connected to a power source.
series circuit,a circuit with only one path.
parallel circuit,a circuit with more than one path.
magnet,an object that attracts iron
magnetism,the pushing or pulling force caused by a magnet
magnetic field,area around a magnet where the forcce of the magnet can act,
magnetic field,caused when a current flows through a circuit.
poles,the ends of a magnet where the magnetism is strongest.
pole,the north and the south blank are the ends of a magnet
electromagnet,a temporary magnet formed when electric current flows through a wire coiled around a metal core
generator,produces electricity by using a coil of wire and a magnet
proton,a particle with a positive charge
electron,a particle with a negative charge
neutral,When an object has the same number of positive and negative charges it is blank.
produce,Electricity can blank magnetism and magnetism can blank electricity.
generators,Electric power plants use huge blank with huge turbines inside them to spin magnets inside the coil of wire.
electromagnets,These are used on cranes to lift cars or metal containers on maglev trains in fire alarms telephones televisions CD players and computers.
electricity,You can produce this by either moving a magnet through a coil of wire or by moving a wire through a magnetic field.
